# Data_Analysis_Evolution_of_Popular_Music
In this project, I analyze data from every song in the Billboard Hot 100 from 1960 - 2010 in an attempt to understand which quantitative music features contribute to shifts in the musical zeitgeist. Through the random decision forest algorithm, I then predict the era and style of a given song based upon 16 quantitative musical features. The report is located in Report.pdf, the r script used in my analysis can be found under the .R file, and the dataset can be found under Music_Evolution_Data.csv.
